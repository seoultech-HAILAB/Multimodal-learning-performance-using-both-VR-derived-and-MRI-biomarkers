# Multimodal-learning-performance-using-both-VR-derived-and-MRI-biomarkers
This repository contains the Python code used for multimodal learning, aiming to enhance the performance of early Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) detection by combining statistically significant Virtual Reality (VR)-derived and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) biomarkers. The chosen machine learning model is the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, known for its effectiveness in similar tasks.

## VR-derived biomarkers
